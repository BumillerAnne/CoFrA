# CoFrA
Nowadays, there are many mechanisms to perform
authentication, such as text passwords and biometrics. How-
ever, reasoning about their relevance (e.g., the appropriateness
for security and usability) regarding the contextual situation
is challenging for an authentication system designers. In this
paper, we present a Context-driven Modelling Framework for
dynamic Authentication decisions (COFRA) where the relevance
of authentication mechanisms is specified according to context
information. COFRA is based on a precise metamodel that reveals
framework abstractions and a set of constraints that specify their
meaning. Therefore, it provides a concrete language to determine
the relevant authentication mechanisms (characterized by a set of
properties that ensure their appropriateness) in a given context.
Authentication system designers can benefit from COFRA to get
recommendations on how to use contextual information for au-
thentication at design time. We validate the proposed framework
through case studies and extensive exchanges with authentication
and modelling experts. We show that model instances describing
real-world use cases and authentication approaches proposed
in the literature can be instantiated validly according to our
metamodel. This validation highlights the necessity, sufficiency
and soundness of our framework.
